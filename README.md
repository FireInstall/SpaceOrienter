# SpaceOrienter

>> Scotty, beam us up! But where? Whats the name of the star over there?
>> Did you mean Riegel, the one at the button?

Our universe is gigant and even our starry sky can be confusing if you are not an expert.
It became even harder if you try to show the sky to a group or you didn't know where you are.
The SpaceOrienter project is a small tool and a solution for all this Problems.
In addition it contains many other ideas and future plans.
This is our new interface with a bunch of new features!
