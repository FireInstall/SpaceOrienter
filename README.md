# SpaceOrienter

Our universe is gigant and even our nightsky can be confusing big and messy if you are not an expert.
It become even harder if you try to show heavenly bodies to other people. 
Or maybe you don't know where to find is what.

The SpaceOrienter project is a small tool and a solution for all problems of this kind.
SpaceOrienter? What is that and how to use it?
The SpaceOrienter startet as "JugendForscht"-project back in 2016 and basicly is a small device, build of an ArduIno(Leonardo), a magneticfied sensor and an acceleration sensor. It points with a weak laser into the sky direkly to the body that was searched for. At the moment it uses for calculating the positions of the bodys an external computer and mainly the crossplatform app will be uploaded here.
But nevertheless, even without the device is the app not useless as it answers many questions about the nightsky and what is waiting to find up there.
